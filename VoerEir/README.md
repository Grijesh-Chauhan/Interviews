⋅⋅* All 4 Questions are must to attempt in Python.
⋅⋅* Time Slot: 90 min

1. Create a reference implementation for a Singleton Class.

2. Create a reference implementation for Factory class which can generate different kind shapes based on shape name. It should be able to fetch all available shape classes and should be easily extensible for new shapes to add without requiring changes in factory.

3. You are given a string that can contain only lower case alphabets, upper case alphabets or numbers. No special character is allowed. Find the longest substring of the given string which has all distinct characters. Examples:
... The longest substring with distinct characters for `"defaasdf"` is either `"defa"` and `"asdf"`, having
... length is 4. Print any one of them. For `"aaaaaaaaa"` the longest substring is `"a"`, with the length of 1.

4. You are given a function:
...```python
def sm(a, b):
    return a + b

... Write a decorator method to print asterisks `'*'` `a + b` times before printing the `sum`, and print the number of characters printed on the screen after the `sum` (ignoring whitespaces). `a` & `b` will always be whole numbers. Example:
... Input:  `a  = 8`, `b = 6`
... Output: `************** 14 16`
