In the first round, Brand Networks give you online competitive programming challenges on HackerRank.
I was given total 4 assignments, 2 Python and 2 SQL (Those I did in MySQL). Programming assignments
level would be easy or medium. I complete all 4 questions in 55 minutes.

In first question of Python assignment, a log of HTTP request/responses was given as input to the
script (that we are to write) to parse the unique GIF file names and write back to some file in the
sorted aphabetically order. It was so easy that I even did not use Regex, just string processing.

decimal number.
