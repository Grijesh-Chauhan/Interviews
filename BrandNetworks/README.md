In the first round, Brand Networks give you online competitive programming challenges on HackerRank.
I was given total 4 assignments, 2 Python and 2 SQL (Those I did in MySQL). Programming assignments
level should be easy or medium. I complete all 4 questions in 55 minutes.

In first question of Python assignment, a log of HTTP request/responses was given as input file to the
script (that I am to write) to parse the unique GIF file names and write back to a output file in
aphabetically sorted order. It was easy and I even did not need to use Regex, just simple string processing.

In second, question a linked list of bits was give to travel, and I was asked to convert bits into equvilent
decimal number.

In SQL, self referencing tabel of stuents-name, friend-name, salary was given. I was asked to print
pairs of student and friend where student salary < fiend slary. The table was a college placement records.
