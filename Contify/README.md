Programming exercise on NLP given by Contify, Delhi


The script `solve.py` is written to be use using Python2.7 with [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/install.html) package installed.


To execute `solve.py`, I have written an `input.txt` (though one can enter data from the console as asked in question)

```bash
$ python  solve.py < input.txt
```

Prese <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>d</kbd> to exit from input screen
